# Hi, I’m Ekaterina Kuksa 👋  
QA Engineer hands-on experience in both manual and automated testing

I’m a QA engineer focused on delivering reliable, well-tested web applications through a combination of thoughtful manual testing and pragmatic automation.

This GitHub profile is my practical QA portfolio created to demonstrate my skiils.
All projects here are based on real, publicly available applications and reflect how I approach testing in real work environments.

---

## 🧭 What This Portfolio Demonstrates

- Test strategy and risk-based testing
- Well-structured manual test cases and checklists
- Clear, reproducible bug reports
- UI and API test automation
- Clean test architecture and readable code
- Continuous integration with automated test execution

I treat QA not as “finding bugs”, but as improving product confidence.

## 🧠 How I Work

- Start with understanding business task and risks
- Prefer fewer meaningful tests over many shallow ones
- Keep test code readable and maintainable
- Document findings clearly so teams can act fast
- Continuously improve test coverage as products evolve

---

## 🚀 Currently Focusing On

- Building a complete QA portfolio project from scratch
- Improving test design and automation reliability
- Visual regression testing
- Dockerized test environments
